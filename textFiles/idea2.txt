First load:

	User info:

		1. Name
		2. Location
		3. email 
		4. Profession of user
		5. Profession of person willing to meet
		6. Gender of both?

Go/Match button >>

Second load:

	For 1st user or user with no match:

		1. Store his/her data in firebase.

		2. Display a msg on screen- "Sorry couldn't find a match right now. We will email you when you get matched."

		3. We don't actually email them, just for demonstration purposes and collecting data.

		4. Optionally we can create a pre-filled database with fake people info so that we can get a match or no match.

	For users with match:

		1. You are meeting "other person name" at a restaurant near you (in an hour??).(we could give them the name of the restaurant so that they find their own means of transport to get there.)

		2. If giving the name of restaurant then >> Display a link saying "Click here to see the website/address of the restaurant"(website url or their address, both can be pulled from the api itself.)

		3. And show the uber or lyft buttons saying you can book a ride to your destination(don't know how to put the co-ordinates for destination and user location here yet.)



How does the match work?:

	1. User 1 Location == User 2 Location (eg: oakland == oakland)

	2. Profession of User 1 == Want to meet this person info of User 2 && Profession of User 2 == Want to meet this person info of User 1.

	3. Gender preference of User 1 == Gender of User 2 && Gender preference of User 2 == Gender of User 1 (optional criteria) 

	4. If all these match then perform action of finding same restaurant for both. Else send "no match msg"
